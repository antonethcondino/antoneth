                    All this time we've been together<br/>
                    And I still don't know how you feel<br/>

                    Maybe it's make believe<br/>
                    Maybe it can be true<br/>
                    I try to tell myself<br/>
                    It's a bad sign, bad sign<br/>
                    I'm not in love with you<br/>
                    I thought that I knew everything<br/>
                    I guess I don't know anything, yeah I get emotional<br/>
                    And hypothetical Wondering if there are all kinds of things
                    I'm not supposed to know I try my best to let it go
                    Baby then you bring me back Bring me back<br/><br/>
